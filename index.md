# About Me


Hello there, welcome to my page UwU!

My name is Yiran and I'm currently a 4th-year student at 
[Western University](https://www.uwo.ca), working on a double major in Biology and Computer Science. I'm currently doing my thesis projects under the supervision of [Dr. Simon Bonner](https://www.uwo.ca/stats/people/bios/simon-bonner.html) and [Dr. Art Poon](https://www.schulich.uwo.ca/microbiologyandimmunology/people/Art%20Poon.html). I study birds' range expansion and viruses' evolution, but there is so much more in nature to explore. 

Outside of school, I'm a trivia collector, a book lover, and a (beginner level) Klingon speaker. Pretty random right?

Wanna know something even more random? Here's some of my trivia collection:

- The number of segments inside a mangosteen equals the number of petals on its bottom \[1\]
- Cattles don't have teeth at the front of their upper jaws \[2\]
- Extra nipples are common, and yes they can milk \[3\] 


If you are interested to contact me for some reason, reach me at: [yshao242@uwo.ca](mailto:yshao242@uwo.ca)
