# About Me

Hello there, welcome to my page UwU!

> That's me with some goldenrods and a gall housing the parasitic goldenrod gall fly, *Eurosta solidaginis*.

My name is Yiran and I'm currently a master's student at the University of Toronto, [Department of Molecular Genetics](https://moleculargenetics.utoronto.ca/). 

I do computational work, mostly on bioinformatics/biostatistics. I'm still doing my rotations at UofT MoGen (i.e., working on miniprojects with temporary supervisors) so I don't yet know what my thesis project would be, but in my undergrad, I've played with birds' range expansion and [viruses' evolution](https://filogeneti.ca/covizu/). Both were tons of fun!

Outside of school, I'm a trivia collector, a book lover, and a (beginner level) Klingon speaker. Pretty random right?

Wanna know something even more random? Here's some of my trivia collection:

- The number of segments inside a mangosteen equals the number of petals on its bottom \[1\]
- Cattles don't have teeth at the front of their upper jaws \[2\]
- Extra nipples are common, and yes they can milk \[3\]
