# Yiran's Personal Website

## Intro
This is the repository for my persoanl website/blog/treehole(?). It's built upon the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the theme [Just-the-Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/). 

## URL
You can see the site in action [here](https://syoutono242.github.io/yiran/).

## Debug Instructions for Myself
It's only here because I'm a goldfish who can't seem to remember how to run my own site when I want to see my changes in action lol.

1. Build the site as you want.

2. Make it available on your local server.
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

3. Brose to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
